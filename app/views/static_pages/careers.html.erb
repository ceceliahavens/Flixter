    <br />
    <p>
      Cecelia is a web devloper, fundraiser, queen of social justice and lover of all things squee! While she would entertain pair programming with you, she is not currently filling any paid positions</p>
  <br />
   <br />
 <p>
   She is also wearing a wig, welding glasses and holding a tiny chihuahua in that painting. That painting is an accurate and true reflection of a typical day at House O' Havens, and a pretty good indicator you don't want to work here!.
